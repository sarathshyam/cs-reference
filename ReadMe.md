# Computer Science- Reference Notes

This is my evergrowing reference on things related to Computer Science and Software Engineering. I started working on documenting this with the intention of becoming a better, more grounded and rounded Software Engineer. I would like to call it the list of *'things I know that I dont know them'*, humbly reminding myself that no man knows it all- the more we have on our *don't know* list, the more rounded we become.

Instead of tools technologies or frameworks, I am learning more on the fundamentals and first principles. 

This is heavily inspired by jwasham's [coding university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university), but the objective is not an interview preparation roadmap.

Hopefully, this will be of some use to anyone dropping by.

Enough of ranting, let's jump right in !.
